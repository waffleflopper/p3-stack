# Swarm

Fan out N parallel workers. They may cover separate slices, race the same brief, or mix both. The parent waits, aggregates, and returns one report.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Set N from the user or derive it from the shape. N is total workers.
4. Pick the worker model from the `swarm workers` line in `p3-models.md` (project root, else `~/.agents/p3-models.md`), resolved through `orchestrator_capabilities`. If the file or that line is missing, run `setup-p3`. For `auto` or `inherit`, omit `target` so the workers run on the parent model. If `delegate_task` rejects the target, fall back to the closest valid model of the same family from `orchestrator_capabilities` and say so. For a model race, name each arm's model up front.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N workers in one turn with `delegate_task`, `mode: "async"`, and the step 4 target, left unset for `auto` or `inherit`. Use `t3_thread_launch` with a `workspaceStrategy` only when a worker needs its own thread, worktree, or branch. One writer per worktree.

Every brief stands alone. Child agents get only the brief, never the parent's context. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Drain with `task_status` until every worker is terminal. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

Keep a compact result table, one-line evidenced issues, and explicit gaps or dropouts.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
